Module_14 belly-button-challenge Assignment 14

#### Overview:
In this assignment,  will build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity datasetLinks to an external site., which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

files are index.html, samples.json, and the static folder. In static folder file is app.js

Instructions
Complete the following steps:

1.  the D3 library to read in samples.json from the URL https://static.bc-edx.com/data/dl-1-2/m14/lms/starter/samples.json.

2. a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.

Use sample_values as the values for the bar chart.

Use otu_ids as the labels for the bar chart.

Use otu_labels as the hovertext for the chart.

3. Create a bubble chart that displays each sample.


Use otu_ids for the x values.

Use sample_values for the y values.

Use sample_values for the marker size.

Use otu_ids for the marker colors.

Use otu_labels for the text values.

4. Display the sample's metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.

Loop through each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object and create a text string.

Append an html tag with that text to the #sample-metadata panel.

5. Update all the plots when a new sample is selected. Additionally, you are welcome to create any layout that you would like for your dashboard.
